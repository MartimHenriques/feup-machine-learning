free throws, turn overs, etc).\n","\n","In [<a href=\"#ref2\">2</a>] the authors identify the characteristic high-dimensionality of the problem, and employ a Support Vector Machine Algorithm that predicted the outcome of a game with 88% accuracy.\n","\n","Among common attributes, the author of [<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a>] found that the most important ones were Free Throws, Offensive Rebounds, Turn Overs and +/- (Plus Minus).\n","They were also able to predict the champion team with an 86% recall using Random Forest.\n","\n","Finally, the authors of [<a href=\"#ref4\">4</a>] used a Naive
