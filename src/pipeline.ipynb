[<a href=\"#ref1\">1</a>]\n","\n","The problem of predicting the outcome of a basketball game has been approached in different ways.\n","A common take on the subject is to try and predict the outcome of a single game, as opposed to the set of qualified teams.\n","Nevertheless, some similarities found between solutions were the use of machine learning algorithms and of similar attributes (rebounds, free throws, turn overs, etc).\n","\n","In [<a href=\"#ref2\">2</a>] the authors identify the characteristic high-dimensionality of the problem, and employ a Support Vector Machine Algorithm that predicted the outcome of a game with 88% accuracy.\n","\n","Among common attributes, the author of [<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a>] found that the most important ones were Free Throws, Offensive Rebounds, Turn Overs and +/- (Plus Minus).\n","They were also able to predict the champion team with an 86% recall using Random Forest.\n","\n","Finally, the authors of [<a href=\"#ref4\">4</a>] used a Naive
